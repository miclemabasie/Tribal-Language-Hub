**Tribal Language Learning Platform**  
*A Community-Driven Digital Ecosystem for Learning a Native Language in Cameroon*

---

### **Introduction**  
Cameroon's linguistic landscape, home to nearly 200 native languages, faces critical erosion as globalization accelerates. Our platform addresses the existential threat to the **Bankon language** (A40) and other tribal tongues by creating a mobile-first preservation system. This initiative empowers communities to digitally safeguard their linguistic heritage while adapting traditional knowledge transmission to modern technological realities.

The system combines elder wisdom validation with mobile learning tools, creating an intergenerational bridge that respects oral traditions while combatting language extinction through structured digital preservation.

### **Problem Statement**  
**Critical Challenges in Native Language Preservation:**  
1. **Endangered Knowledge:** 37% of Cameroonian languages risk extinction within 2 generations (UNESCO Atlas) 
2. **Transmission Breakdown:** Youth migration and educational priorities displacing traditional learning  
3. **Fragmented Resources:** Existing materials lack standardization and cultural context validation  
4. **Technological Exclusion:** No mobile-native tools designed for oral tradition preservation  
5. **Dialect Erosion:** Urban influences homogenizing regional language variations

### **Solution Overview**  
**Three-Pillar Approach:**  
1. **Digitally Encoded Oral Tradition**  
   - Elder-validated content preservation  
   - Dialect-specific learning paths  

2. **Community-Owned Infrastructure**  
   - Tribal control over content and access  
   - Village committee moderation tools  

3. **Cultural Context Learning**  
   - Language tied to traditions, not just vocabulary  
   - Agricultural cycles integrated with lessons

**2. Adaptive Learning Engine**  
- Progress-triggered difficulty adjustment  
- Contextual quiz types:  
  - Voice comparison (learner vs elder recordings)  
  - Cultural scenario simulations  
  - Proverb completion exercises  

**3. Community Interaction Layer**  
- **Apprentice Chat System:**  
  - Scheduled virtual sessions with certified elders  
  - Cultural protocol reminders during interactions  

- **Village Noticeboard:**
